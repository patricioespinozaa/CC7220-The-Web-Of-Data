# The Web of Data

This repository contains the development of the project and labs for the course The Web of Data, taught by Aidan Hogan. <br>

## Project: STREAMFUSION RDF

The project consisted of studying the relationship between movies/series available on multiple streaming platforms simultaneously. To achieve this, CSV data was transformed into RDF triples using mrlmapper, resulting in a TTL file, which was queried using SPARQL through an Apache Jena Fuseki Endpoint.
